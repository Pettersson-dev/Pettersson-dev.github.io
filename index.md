Hi, I’m David Pettersson

I am an enterprise and domain architect with experience across telecom, finance, insurance, and retail.  
This site is where I share perspectives on **target architectures, service design, and capability-driven transformation**.  

Much of my writing builds on frameworks such as **EDGY by Intersection**, **TM Forum ODA**, and **TOGAF**, applied to real-world architecture challenges.  
The goal is to make complex change more tangible by connecting strategy, capabilities, and technology.  

Highlights include: 
- [Convenience Retail Mobile Blueprint]({% post_url 2025-09-20-retail-convenience-cx %})
- [TOGAF ADM in Practice]({% post_url 2025-09-20-adm %})
- [Leading indicators in digital transformation]({% post_url 2025-09-21-transformation-leading-indicators %})
