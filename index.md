Hi, I’m **David Pettersson**.  

I am an **enterprise and domain architect** with experience across telecom, finance, insurance, and retail.  
This site is where I share perspectives on **target architectures, service design, and capability-driven transformation**.  

Much of my writing builds on frameworks such as **EDGY by Intersection**, **TM Forum ODA**, and **TOGAF** — applied to real-world architecture challenges.  
My goal is to make complex change more tangible by connecting **strategy, capabilities, and technology**.
