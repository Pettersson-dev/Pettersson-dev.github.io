This website contains my own thoughts, reflection and work. Oppinions and choices are my own.

I am a technical professional dedicated to improving efficiency and business value by enabling teams and individuals in digital transformation. I genuinely believe that the key to efficiency is Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose and that business value is achieved by speed of iteration. My contribution is to enable that transformation by providing technical leadership and business knowledge by coaching, guiding, teaching and leading by example.
