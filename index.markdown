Hi, I’m David Pettersson

I am an enterprise and domain architect with experience across telecom, finance, insurance, and retail.  
This site is where I share perspectives on **target architectures, service design, and capability-driven transformation**.  

Much of my writing builds on frameworks such as **EDGY by Intersection**, **TM Forum ODA**, and **TOGAF**, applied to real-world architecture challenges.  
The goal is to make complex change more tangible by connecting strategy, capabilities, and technology.  

Highlights include: 
- [Convenience Retail Mobile Blueprint](/enterprise%20architecture/service%20design/retail-convenience-cx/)  For background, read [From Blueprint to Execution: Finance Target Architecture]({% post_url 2025-09-21-finance-blueprint-execution %}).
- [TOGAF ADM in Practice](/adm/)
- [Leading indicators in digital transformation](/transformation/leadership/transformation-leading-indicators/)

If you’d like to continue the conversation, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davepettersson/).
