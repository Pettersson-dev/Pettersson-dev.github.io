When organizations measure transformation, they often look at **lagging indicators**:  
- ROI after a project has closed  
- Cost savings once a system is retired  
- Customer satisfaction after a service redesign  

These are useful, but by the time we see them, it’s already too late to change course.  

## Leading indicators
Leading indicators are **early signals** that tell us if we’re moving in the right direction.  

Examples:  
- **Adoption**: Are people starting to use the new process, tool, or platform?  
- **Engagement**: Are customers exploring a new channel or service option, even if volumes are still low?  
- **Collaboration**: Are teams working across silos in ways they didn’t before?  

These don’t prove success yet — but they show whether momentum is building.  


## Why it matters in architecture
As architects, we often design **target states** and **roadmaps**. But real transformation depends on *behavioral shifts*.  

- If employees start choosing the new way of working over the old one, that’s a leading indicator.  
- If stakeholders begin to frame needs in terms of **capabilities** rather than systems, that’s a leading indicator.  
- If early usage metrics show that customers are trying out the new service, that’s a leading indicator.  


## My reflection
When I coach or lead architectural change, I’ve learned to celebrate these **small early signals**.  
They don’t guarantee outcomes — but they **predict direction**.  

Transformation is less about the final ROI graph, and more about noticing the first signs of *a new way of working*.  

## Quick checklist: spotting leading indicators
When shaping your own transformation, ask:  

1. **Behavior** – What early changes in how people work would prove momentum?  
2. **Usage** – How will we know the new platform, process, or channel is actually being tried?  
3. **Collaboration** – What visible signs of new partnerships or habits can we track?  

If you can answer these three questions, you already have the **first draft of your leading indicators**.
