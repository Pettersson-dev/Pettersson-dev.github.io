Securing the application and runtime.
Principles
* Apply defense in depth
* Use a positive security model (fail-safe defaults, minimize attack surface)
* Fail securely
* Run with least privilege
* Avoid security by obscurity (open design)
* Keep security simple (verifiable, economy of mechanism)
* Detect intrusions (compromise recording)
* Don’t trust infrastructure
* Don’t trust services
* Establish secure defaults (psychological acceptability)
* Keep information on a neeed to know basis.
* Clear secrets and prevent them from being shared or visible.
* State should be immutable.
* State changes should be declarative.
* Virtual machines should be avoided
* Runtime should protect against overflows
* Keep runtime up to date.
* Avoid unnecessary logging. 
* Mask or obfuscate sensitive information in logs.
* Don't log secrets
* Have health checks and metrics
* Perform peer reviews
* Don't trust input
* Control and verify output
