# From Target Architecture to Enterprise Design Blueprint for Finance

In my [previous post, updated on September 1 2025](https://pettersson.dev/finance-target-architecture/), I outlined a modern finance target architecture using core ERP, reporting, a finance data hub, and BI/analytics. That post covered how these components fit together for compliance, reporting, and strategic insight.

This follow-up shows how to **turn that architecture into a structured Enterprise Design Blueprint**—a model that connects capabilities, information, organizational structure, technology, and user experiences to drive decisions and investments.

## 1. Scope and Outcomes

- **Scope:** Finance operations, financial close, consolidation, statutory reporting, data hub (integration + MDM), BI, and advanced analytics.  
- **Outcomes:** Faster and auditable close, single source of truth, governed data products, predictive planning, and self-service insights.

## 2. Blueprint Facets

**Intent**  
- Purpose: Deliver compliant, timely, and explainable finance information  
- Value: Reliable reporting, governed data, predictive insights  
- Success Metrics: Close cycle time, report lead time, forecast accuracy, audit findings

**Experiences**  
- CFO monthly close and board reporting  
- Controller variance analysis and rolling forecast  
- Business leader self-service KPI drill-downs  
- Auditor traceability and lineage validation

**Capabilities**  
- Record to Report (GL, AP, AR)  
- Consolidation and Close  
- Revenue Recognition and Allocation  
- Planning, Budgeting, Forecasting  
- Regulatory and Management Reporting  
- Data Integration and Master Data Management  
- BI Self-Service and Advanced Analytics

**Organization**  
- Finance Operations  
- Group Consolidation and Reporting  
- FP&A  
- Data Platform Team  
- Information Governance  
- Security and Risk

**Information**  
- Chart of Accounts, Journal, Ledger, Trial Balance  
- Consolidated Financial Statements  
- Entities, Cost Centers, Products, Projects  
- KPIs and Metrics (margins, cash flow, working capital)

**Technology**  
- ERP / Accounting System  
- Reporting and Close Tools  
- Enterprise Data Hub (ETL/MDM, lineage, APIs)  
- BI and Analytics Platform

## 5. Design Principles

1. ERP and Close are systems of record — analytics never writes back.  
2. One semantic layer for KPIs — multiple visualizations, one definition.  
3. Data as a product — owned, documented, with SLAs.  
4. Lineage and audit by design.  
5. APIs and event streams for integration.  
6. Zero Trust and role-based access.  
7. Cloud-agnostic where possible.  
8. Incremental rollout — coexistence with legacy systems.

## 6. Roadmap

**Wave 1: Stabilize**  
- CDC from ERP to Data Hub  
- Basic reporting pack from consolidated ledger

**Wave 2: Unify and Govern**  
- Introduce MDM for chart of accounts and entities  
- Replace ad-hoc reports with governed BI

**Wave 3: Predict and Automate**  
- Rolling forecasts using machine learning  
- Self-service data portal for finance users

## 7. Conclusion

If the target architecture shows *what* to build, this Enterprise Design Blueprint shows *how* to organize and govern it. By mapping capabilities, information, technology, and organization together, finance can move beyond compliance to become a strategic partner—delivering insights at the speed of business.
