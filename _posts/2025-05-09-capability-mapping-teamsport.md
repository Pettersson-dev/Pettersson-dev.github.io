Everyone talks about capability mapping. But the real question is:
What outcomes are you trying to drive?

Because a map isn’t the goal. The goal is:

	•	Better strategic alignment
	•	Smarter investment decisions
	•	Clearer ownership
	•	More adaptive delivery
	•	Shared understanding across silos

You don’t get those outcomes by mapping in a corner.
You get them by making capability mapping a team sport and EDGY is the playbook that gets everyone on the field, speaking the same language, and moving in the same direction.

### Capability Mapping Is a Team Sport – and EDGY Is the Playbook

In the fast-paced world of digital transformation, every organization is chasing adaptability, alignment, and speed. But getting there isn’t just about deploying the latest technology. It’s about understanding what your organization is capable of — and aligning those capabilities to strategy, structure, and delivery. That’s where capability mapping comes in.

But here’s the catch: capability mapping isn’t a solo activity. It’s a team sport — and EDGY is the playbook that helps everyone play the same game.

What Is Capability Mapping, Really?

At its core, a capability map is a structured view of what an organization does — not how it does it, or who does it, or with what tools — but what it must be able to do to fulfill its mission. Think of it as a common language between business, IT, and operations. It’s the foundation for meaningful discussions about priorities, investments, and change.

But too often, these maps are created in isolation — by architects, consultants, or strategy teams — and then handed over to the rest of the organization. That’s like drawing up a game plan without including the players.

Why Capability Mapping Is a Team Sport

You can’t map what you don’t understand. And no single role — not the CIO, not the enterprise architect, not even the CEO — understands the full picture. It takes input from product managers, operations leaders, developers, customer support, and more. Each perspective adds a crucial piece to the puzzle.

Collaboration turns capability mapping from an abstract exercise into a shared sense-making process. Done well, it creates alignment across silos, surfaces mismatches between ambition and ability, and fosters ownership over outcomes.

But collaboration needs structure — and that’s where the EDGY framework shines.

EDGY: The Playbook for Mapping Together

EDGY is a modeling framework developed by Intersection Group, designed to make organizational complexity navigable. It helps teams model their enterprise across four fundamental aspects: Identity, Structure, Capabilities, and Experiences.

In the context of capability mapping, EDGY offers three major advantages:
	1.	A Shared Language
EDGY’s formal yet approachable definitions help different stakeholders talk about the same things in the same way. For example, a “capability” in EDGY is not a process or a system — it’s the ability to create value under certain conditions. That clarity is powerful.
	2.	A Visual Canvas
The EDGY canvas provides a visual, structured format for mapping capabilities and relating them to strategies, services, and roles. This makes it easier to engage stakeholders in workshops and sense-making sessions.
	3.	Connections Across the Enterprise
EDGY doesn’t stop at capability maps. It connects capabilities to the experiences you want to create, the structures you need to support them, and the identities that give them purpose. That holistic view is essential for transformation.

How to Make It Work

Making capability mapping a team sport isn’t just about using EDGY. It’s about changing how you think about the activity:
	•	Start with purpose. Why are you mapping capabilities? What decisions will it inform?
	•	Bring in the right people. Include voices from strategy, delivery, operations, and support.
	•	Use visuals. Maps, canvases, and models are tools for co-creation, not just documentation.
	•	Iterate openly. Capability maps are living artifacts — not set in stone.

Final Thoughts

In a world where alignment is everything and silos are the enemy, capability mapping can be a game-changer. But only if it’s done collaboratively.

Think of EDGY as your playbook — a structured, visual, and shared approach that brings the team together. Because when everyone plays the same game, you don’t just map capabilities. You unlock them.
