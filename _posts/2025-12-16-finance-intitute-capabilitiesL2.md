## Introduction

In the previous post, we introduced a Level 1 (L1) capability map for financial institutions, providing an enterprise-wide view of what a financial organization must be able to do.

The natural next step is to decompose these high-level domains into **Level 2 (L2) capabilities**.

L2 capabilities describe **distinct, stable business abilities** that sit below enterprise domains and above detailed processes and systems. This level is often the most useful for transformation planning, regulatory analysis, application mapping, and portfolio prioritization.

This post presents a pragmatic L2 capability decomposition aligned with the previously defined L1 capability map.

## Why Level 2 Matters

Level 2 capabilities provide the optimal balance between strategic abstraction and operational relevance.

They are commonly used to:
- map applications, data domains, and ownership  
- assess regulatory impact and compliance coverage  
- prioritize initiatives and investments  
- define capability maturity and target states  
- support architecture governance and portfolio decisions  

For many organizations, L2 becomes the **primary working level** in enterprise architecture tools and transformation programs.

## Closing Thoughts

A well-defined L2 capability map turns high-level strategy into something **actionable and governable**.

Combined with L1, it provides a stable backbone for regulatory change, digital transformation, and long-term architectural planning in financial institutions.

Future follow-ups can extend this work into:
- L3 capability decomposition  
- capability-to-process mapping  
- capability-to-system and data alignment  
- maturity assessment and target roadmaps
