# Introducing the Finance Target Architecture Series

Finance is under pressure like never before. Beyond accurate bookkeeping, modern finance functions are expected to deliver **real-time insights**, **faster closes**, and **predictive forecasts** — all while ensuring compliance and auditability.  

To achieve this, organizations need more than just an ERP upgrade. They need a **target architecture** that ties together core finance systems, reporting tools, data hubs, and analytics into a coherent, governed whole.  

This blog series will explore:  
- Why target architectures matter for finance  
- How ERP, reporting, and BI fit together  
- The role of data hubs and master data management  
- Practical design principles for resilient, future-ready finance  
- A roadmap from “as-is” to “to-be”  

The first article will lay out a **target architecture for finance** and explain how its components interact. Follow-up posts will dive deeper into governance, design blueprints, and logical data architectures.  

Stay tuned!
