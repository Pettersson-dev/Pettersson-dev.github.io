The TOGAF ADM (Architecture Development Method) is a well-known and well-defined framework for structuring architecture work. However, in many organizations it’s perceived as abstract or overly theoretical. In this post, I don’t try to reproduce ADM in full. Instead, I show a simplified, concrete version of how I’ve applied ADM in practice, tailored to a transformation context.

## Why TOGAF ADM?
ADM provides a systematic method to:
- Create order and structure in architectural work  
- Ensure traceability from business drivers to roadmap  
- Build shared understanding between business and IT  

But in practice, ADM needs to be translated into clear, actionable steps that resonate with the organization.

## My Adapted ADM Process
Below is a customized interpretation of the ADM cycle, where each step is linked to capabilities, domains, technology choices, and integration strategy:

### Step 1: Baseline Analysis
Everything starts with a clear understanding of the current state: existing systems, integration patterns, and business processes.

### Step 2: Target State and Drivers
Transformation should be anchored in **why** change is needed: efficiency, improved customer experience, regulatory compliance, or scalability.

### Step 3: Capability-Based Planning
Identify business capabilities, map value streams, and highlight capability areas that need to be strengthened. Capability maps become a central tool for connecting business strategy to architecture.

### Step 4: Domains and Subdomains
From capabilities, define digital building blocks. In my example, domains include customer interaction, transactions & payments, order & inventory, analytics & insights, and business administration. These are mapped to systems like CRM, ERP, Payment platform, Datawarehouse, BI, and others.

### Step 5: Integration Strategy
A robust integration architecture is critical. Here I emphasize:
- **API First**  
- **Event-Driven Architecture**  
- **API Gateway**  
- **Master Data Flows**  

### Step 6: Roadmap
Finally, translate target state and capabilities into a sequenced roadmap. This shows how initiatives align over time and deliver value step by step.

## Key Learnings
- ADM always needs to be adapted to the organization’s language and context  
- Capability-based planning keeps the architecture business-driven  
- Integration strategy is the glue that holds domains and solutions together  
- The roadmap must be realistic, iterative, and tied to tangible value  

## Closing Thoughts
TOGAF ADM is more than a method – it’s a structure for clarity, trust, and transformation. By making the steps concrete and connecting them to capabilities, domains, and integration patterns, ADM becomes not only usable but powerful in practice.
