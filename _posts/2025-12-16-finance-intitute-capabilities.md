## Introduction

Financial institutions operate in one of the most complex and highly regulated environments of any industry. Strategic objectives, capital requirements, risk management, regulatory compliance, sustainability mandates, and operational efficiency must all be balanced simultaneously.

To manage this complexity, organizations need a shared and stable structure that bridges strategy, business, IT, risk, and data. An **enterprise capability map** provides exactly that foundation.

This article presents a **Level 1 (L1) capability map for financial institutions**, suitable for banks, credit institutions, and policy-driven financial organizations. It can be used as a baseline for business architecture, transformation planning, and target architecture development.

## Why Capability Mapping Matters in Financial Services

A capability map describes **what the organization must be able to do**, independent of how it is organized or which systems are used.

In financial institutions, capability mapping helps to:

- Create traceability between strategy, regulation, and execution  
- Assess the impact of new regulatory requirements  
- Prioritize investments and transformation initiatives  
- Align business, risk, finance, data, and IT  
- Provide stability during organizational or system changes  

Because capabilities evolve slowly, they form a reliable anchor for long-term architectural and transformation work.
