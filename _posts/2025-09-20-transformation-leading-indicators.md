# Leading Indicators for Change: Spotting Early Signals Before It’s Too Late  

When organizations embark on a transformation, whether digital, cultural, or structural, the temptation is to measure success using lagging indicators. These are the hard numbers that come after the fact: revenue growth, customer satisfaction scores, market share, reduced operating costs.  

Lagging indicators are important, but they are also rearview mirrors. They tell you what has already happened, not what is about to happen. If you want to steer change effectively, you need to look ahead using leading indicators, the early signals that predict the likelihood of success or failure.  

## What Are Leading Indicators?  
Leading indicators are measurable actions or patterns that occur early in a change journey. They give you a glimpse into momentum, adoption, and behavior before the big results show up. Think of them as the “canaries in the coal mine” for transformation.  

They are often softer, behavior-based, and qualitative, but they are powerful predictors of whether your change effort is on track.

## Examples of Leading Indicators for Change  

### 1. Employee Engagement in Change Activities  
**What to look for** includes attendance at workshops, active contributions in feedback sessions, and the number of employees volunteering for pilot initiatives.  

**Why it matters** is that if people show up and contribute, they are signaling belief and energy. Low engagement is an early warning that change has not landed.  

**Example:** A hospital introducing a new digital patient portal tracks how many nurses and doctors attend optional training sessions. Early participation predicts later adoption rates.  

---

### 2. Speed of Decision-Making  
**What to look for** is the time taken from identifying a problem to making a decision and acting on it.  

**Why it matters** is that a faster tempo signals that teams are adapting and comfortable with new ways of working. Slow decisions may indicate resistance or confusion.  

**Example:** An engineering firm implementing agile ways of working measures whether cross-functional teams resolve blockers within 48 hours instead of waiting for escalation.

### 3. Experimentation and Learning Velocity  
**What to look for** is the number of experiments run, lessons documented, and iterations made.  

**Why it matters** is that a healthy transformation culture thrives on testing and learning quickly.  

**Example:** A retailer shifting toward online sales tracks how often product teams release small A/B tests on their website. A rise in testing activity is a leading indicator that digital practices are sticking.

### 4. Customer Curiosity and Early Adoption  
**What to look for** includes the uptake of beta programs, the number of customers signing up for pilots, or engagement with new features.  

**Why it matters** is that customers exploring new offerings signal that the value proposition resonates even before revenue numbers catch up.  

**Example:** A bank introducing mobile ID verification sees 30 percent of customers opting in during the pilot phase, a strong leading sign of eventual mass adoption.

### 5. Collaboration Across Silos  
**What to look for** includes the number of cross-departmental initiatives, shared documents, or joint workshops.  

**Why it matters** is that most change fails not because of technology but because old organizational boundaries remain. Collaboration is an early proof point that barriers are coming down.  

**Example:** A manufacturing company introducing sustainability practices counts how many product teams and supply chain managers collaborate on lifecycle assessments. This is a leading indicator of future environmental impact reductions.

## Turning Leading Indicators into Action  
Leading indicators should not remain abstract. They should be defined clearly by choosing behaviors or actions that can actually be observed or measured. They should be tracked consistently by making them part of dashboards or regular retrospectives. They should be connected to lagging indicators by showing how early behaviors eventually impact outcomes, so teams understand the causal link.

## Final Thought  
Change leadership is often described as walking in the fog. Lagging indicators are the road signs you see too late. Leading indicators are the faint lights ahead that help you steer before you drift off course.  

By paying attention to the early signals such as engagement, decision speed, experimentation, adoption, and collaboration, you can adjust your approach in real time, increasing the odds of a successful transformation.
