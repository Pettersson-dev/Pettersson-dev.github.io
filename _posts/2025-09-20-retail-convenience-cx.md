Designing a compelling **retail mobile experience** requires more than just features—it demands a structured service design blueprint that connects **customer journeys, applications, and enterprise capabilities**. Using the [EDGY](https://intersection.group/edgy) framework, we can visualize how customer value is created by aligning **experience, capabilities, and technology**.

The diagram above illustrates a **service design blueprint** for a convenience retail mobile experience. It highlights three layers of design thinking:


## Customer Experience
At the top we see the **customer-facing intentions**—what people actually want to achieve:

- Receive offers & promotions  
- Access loyalty benefits  
- Purchase products & manage payments  
- Find store locations  
- Get better offers & gamified rewards  
- Send gifts or subscribe to essentials  
- Eat & drink, including integrations with delivery partners (e.g., Uber Eats, Foodora)

These intentions anchor the design around **jobs-to-be-done** rather than isolated features.


## Application Layer
The middle layer captures **application features** that bring those experiences to life:

- Digital coupons, loyalty stamps, and digital receipts  
- Payment & transaction services  
- Store locator & geo-services  
- Digital offers, push notifications, and referral programs  
- Games and gamification features  
- Gift cards and subscription models (notably marked as **missing** in this study and often become features in later releases).

This layer shows how **app design must bundle transactional, promotional, and engagement features** in a cohesive experience.


## Capability Layer
Finally, the foundation: **enterprise capabilities**. These ensure the retail ecosystem can scale and adapt:

- Offer & Discount Management and Campaign Management  
- Payment & Transaction Processing with catalog, loyalty, and rewards integration  
- Customer Engagement & Marketing supported by Analytics & Insights  
- Gamification & Engagement Management  
- Order & Subscription Management with billing and charging support  
- Location & Resource Inventory Management for operational execution  

By making capabilities explicit, we avoid the trap of feature-only thinking. Instead, the blueprint shows how **capabilities drive resilience, scalability, and future innovation**.


## Why This Matters
Most retail apps fail because they stop at the **feature level**. This EDGY-inspired blueprint makes it clear:  

- Customer outcomes are the north star  
- Applications translate outcomes into digital touchpoints  
- Capabilities ensure long-term viability and adaptability  

With this structured view, retailers can prioritize investments, identify missing capabilities (e.g., subscription management), and design experiences that **truly deliver value**.


## Final Thoughts
The blueprint is not just a diagram—it’s a **conversation tool**. It helps business leaders, architects, and designers align around the same service vision.  

When retailers adopt this approach, they don’t just build an app.  
They build an **ecosystem of loyalty, engagement, and convenience** that meets customers where they are—today and tomorrow.
