# From Target Architecture to Design Blueprint for Finance

In my [previous post, updated on September 1 2025](https://pettersson.dev/finance-target-architecture/), I outlined a modern finance target architecture using core ERP, reporting, a finance data hub, and BI/analytics. That post covered how these components fit together for compliance, reporting, and strategic insight.

This follow-up shows how to turn that architecture into a structured model that connects capabilities, information, organizational structure, technology, and user experiences to drive decisions and investments.

## 1. Scope and Outcomes

- **Scope:** Finance operations, financial close, consolidation, statutory reporting, data hub (integration + MDM), BI, and advanced analytics.

   Crosscutting concerns
   - Catalog and lineage
   - Data quality and observability
   - Security and access control
   - Audit and retention

## 5. Design Principles

1. ERP and Close are systems of record â€” analytics never writes back.  
2. One semantic layer for KPIs â€” multiple visualizations, one definition.  
3. Data as a product â€” owned, documented, with SLAs.  
4. Lineage and audit by design.  
5. APIs and event streams for integration.  
6. Zero Trust and role-based access.  
7. Cloud-agnostic where possible.  
8. Incremental rollout â€” coexistence with legacy systems.

## 6. Roadmap

**Wave 1: Stabilize**  
- CDC from ERP to Data Hub  
- Basic reporting pack from consolidated ledger

**Wave 2: Unify and Govern**  
- Introduce MDM for chart of accounts and entities  
- Replace ad-hoc reports with governed BI

**Wave 3: Predict and Automate**  
- Rolling forecasts using machine learning  
- Self-service data portal for finance users
