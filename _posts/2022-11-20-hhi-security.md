* Verify the recipient, eg. is there trust
* Mind the surroundings, is the location safe?
* Share information on a needs to know basis
* All communication should be equal

* Trust chain should be short, preferably first hand
* Use more trust anchors to verify information
* Information should be complete, with provided context, to avoid misconceptions
* Non-public written information should be enveloped, or equally protected, in transport
