excerpt: "CI/CD - continuous integration/continuous delivery"

In todayâ€™s tech-driven world, businesses need to stay ahead of the competition and keep up with customer demand. To do this, they must be agile and autonomous; meaning that they can quickly develop, deploy, and maintain applications with minimal human intervention. This is where continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) comes in.

CI/CD is an automation process that enables businesses to quickly and reliably deploy applications, with minimal human intervention. It involves integrating code from multiple developers into a single source code repository, automating the build, test, and deployment process, and then delivering the application to an end user. This process helps companies streamline their development and deployment process, and ultimately gives them the autonomy they need to quickly adapt to changing customer needs and stay competitive.

The benefits of CI/CD for companies include improved visibility into the development process, faster time-to-market, and improved quality assurance. CI/CD also helps companies to maintain autonomy, as they can quickly and reliably deploy new features and updates to their applications without relying on manual intervention. Finally, CI/CD makes it easier for teams to collaborate, as developers can quickly integrate code from multiple teams and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
