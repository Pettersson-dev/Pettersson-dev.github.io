## Introduction

In the previous post, we introduced a Level 1 (L1) capability map for financial institutions, providing an enterprise-wide view of what a financial organization must be able to do.

The natural next step is to decompose these high-level domains into **Level 2 (L2) capabilities**.

L2 capabilities describe **distinct, stable business abilities** that sit below enterprise domains and above detailed processes and systems. This level is often the most useful for transformation planning, regulatory analysis, application mapping, and portfolio prioritization.

This post presents a pragmatic L2 capability decomposition aligned with the previously defined L1 capability map.

## Closing Thoughts

A well-defined Level 2 capability map turns high-level strategy into something **actionable and governable**.

Combined with the Level 1 capability map, it provides a stable backbone for regulatory change, digital transformation, and long-term architectural planning in financial institutions.

Future follow-ups can naturally extend this work into:
- Level 3 capability decomposition  
- capability-to-process mapping  
- capability-to-system and data alignment  
- maturity assessment and target roadmaps
