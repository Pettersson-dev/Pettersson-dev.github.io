# From Blueprint to Execution: Making Finance Target Architecture Real

In the [first post](https://pettersson.dev/finance-target-architecture/), I outlined a **target architecture for finance** — built on ERP, reporting, a finance data hub, and BI. In the [second post](https://pettersson.dev/finance-target-architecture-design/), I explored how to **translate that architecture into a design blueprint** with capabilities, intersections, and logical components.  

This third and final post looks at the next step: **execution**. How do organizations move from blueprint to reality?  

## 1. Why Execution Is Hard

Designing a target architecture is inspiring, but execution is where most initiatives stall. Common challenges include:  

- **Legacy systems:** Difficult integrations, slow performance, and fragmented data.  
- **Siloed ownership:** Finance, IT, and business units may not share the same priorities.  
- **Data quality gaps:** Reporting suffers if master data and hierarchies are not aligned.  
- **Change management:** New processes and tools require adoption across the business.  

## 2. Governance and Ownership

Execution starts with **clear ownership**:  

- Finance owns processes and definitions (chart of accounts, KPIs, reporting rules).  
- IT owns platforms and integrations.  
- Data governance ensures quality, lineage, and access control.  

Without this accountability, even the best architecture risks becoming shelfware.  

## 3. Incremental Roadmap

Big-bang transformations rarely succeed. Instead, execution should follow a **phased roadmap**:  

- **Phase 1: Stabilize**  
  - Identify system of record (ERP, Close).  
  - Set up data ingestion and initial reporting packs.  
- **Phase 2: Unify and Govern**  
  - Introduce master data management.  
  - Replace ad-hoc reporting with governed BI.  
- **Phase 3: Predict and Automate**  
  - Add forecasting and scenario planning with ML.  
  - Provide self-service data products for finance users.  

This approach ensures visible value at every step.  

## 4. Continuous Improvement

Target architectures are not static. Continuous improvement means:  

- Regularly reviewing KPIs and data quality metrics.  
- Adjusting the semantic layer as business evolves.  
- Expanding data hub integrations to new domains (HR, supply chain, sales).  
- Embracing new analytics capabilities as they mature.  

## 5. Lessons Learned

From working with finance and architecture teams, three lessons stand out:  

1. **Start with outcomes.** Technology choices matter less than delivering faster closes, better forecasts, and trusted reports.  
2. **Invest in data governance early.** Without consistent master data, BI and analytics cannot deliver on their promise.  
3. **Adoption beats perfection.** It is better to deliver a good-enough semantic layer with clear KPIs than to aim for a perfect model.  

## 6. Conclusion

Over this series, we’ve gone from:  

- A **target architecture** for finance (ERP + reporting + data hub + BI).  
- To a **design blueprint** mapping capabilities, information, and technology.  
- And now to **execution strategies** that make the vision real.
